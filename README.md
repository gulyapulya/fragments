This is a node.js based REST API that is created as part of the CCP555 course.
Currently, completed the first lab. I am the only contributor, but the course materials are being used.

## Useful commands to remember:

### eslint

npm run lint

### start

npm start
runs our server normally

### dev

npm run dev
uns it via nodemon, which watches the src/\*\* folder for any changes, restarting the server whenever something is updated

### debug

npm run debug
also starts the node inspector on port 9229, so that a debugger can be attached (e.g., VSCode)
